# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a web application that uses camera access to perform facial recognition, integrates with ChatGPT to gather information about identified individuals, and displays interactive bubbles that can link to LinkedIn profiles when found. The system will provide real-time facial detection and information overlay functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my camera through the website, so that the system can capture my face for recognition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the website THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions
2. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display a live video feed from the user's camera
3. WHEN camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. IF the user's device has multiple cameras THEN the system SHALL use the front-facing camera by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect and recognize my face in real-time, so that it can identify who I am.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a face appears in the camera feed THEN the system SHALL detect the face boundaries
2. WHEN a face is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt facial recognition processing
3. WHEN facial recognition is successful THEN the system SHALL identify the person with confidence scoring
4. IF multiple faces are detected THEN the system SHALL process each face independently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use ChatGPT to find information about me, so that relevant details can be displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a person is identified THEN the system SHALL query ChatGPT with the person's identity
2. WHEN ChatGPT responds THEN the system SHALL extract relevant professional information
3. WHEN information is found THEN the system SHALL format it for display
4. IF no information is available THEN the system SHALL display a "no information found" message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an information bubble above my head, so that I can view the gathered information about myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN facial recognition identifies a person THEN the system SHALL display a bubble above the detected face
2. WHEN information is available THEN the bubble SHALL show the person's name and key details
3. WHEN the face moves THEN the bubble SHALL follow the face position in real-time
4. IF the face leaves the frame THEN the bubble SHALL disappear

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bubble to link to my LinkedIn profile when found, so that I can access my professional profile directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LinkedIn profile information is found THEN the bubble SHALL include a clickable LinkedIn link
2. WHEN the LinkedIn link is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the LinkedIn profile in a new tab
3. WHEN no LinkedIn profile is found THEN the bubble SHALL not display a LinkedIn link
4. IF multiple LinkedIn profiles are found THEN the system SHALL display the most relevant match

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle privacy and security appropriately, so that my facial data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN facial recognition is performed THEN the system SHALL not store facial images permanently
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL clear temporary facial data
3. WHEN the user leaves the page THEN the system SHALL stop camera access immediately
4. IF facial recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling without exposing sensitive data and there should be a bubble saying no result with an X
